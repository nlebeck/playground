# Crunching numbers from levels.fyi

This directory contains some scripts I made to process and graph data from
[levels.fyi][levels-url]. I wanted to see the shape of the data
rather than just averages. I couldn't find any CSVs of the data, so I just
copy/pasted data straight from the website and wrote scripts to operate on
that.

If you want to use these scripts, you should copy/paste some data from
[levels.fyi][levels-url], put them in files in a `data` subdirectory, and
replace the placeholder names and filenames in `wrapper.pl` with the
appropriate values.
